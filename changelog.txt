# 0.0.2.1-beta4 - Region overlapping hotfix
## Fixes
* Fix overlapping regions not correctly considering priority and region member/ownership.
From now on, regions with the highest priority always should be the deciding region regarding flags.
* Fix Local Regions not overwriting their parent region flags (either Dimensional or Local Regions).
Local Regions show now disable flags from their parent regions, if they don't define the flags themselves.
The following table show how flags are handled for region hierarchies:
|Parent       | Child           | Result |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
|flag set     | flag set        | deny   |
|flag not set | flag set        | deny   |
|flag set     | flag not set    | allow  |
|flag set     | no child region | deny   |
* Fix removing teams from regions not working properly
# 0.0.2.0-beta4 - CLI pagination & new flags
## Additions
* Add flag `use-elytra`. This flag prevents players from using the elytra for flying.
Specifically, it prevents players from starting. It does not force players to land when they are flying in a zone with this flag.
* Add flag `no-flight`. This flag prevents players from flying in a region. It also forces players to fall.
* Add flag `enter-dim` for Dimensional Regions. This flag prevents players from traveling (using a portal or teleporting) to the dimension which has this flag active.
* Add flag `mob-griefing` to prevent mob griefing.
* Add flag `enderman-griefing` to prevent enderman from picking up and placing blocks. This replaces the now removed flag `entity-place`.
* Add pagination support for flags, regions/children, players and teams for the CLI
* Add config option for amount of entries (flags, regions, players or teams) per page: `cli_entries_per_page`. It's located in the `yawp-region-defaults.toml`. It defaults to 5 entries per page.
* Reintroduced the config option to choose the mods root command: `wp_root_command`. It's located in the `yawp-common.toml` config. You are able to choose between `/wp` and `/yawp`, with `/wp` being the default.

* Replace most team names in the CLI with team info links

# 0.0.1.4-beta4 - CLI improvements & priority fixes
## Additions
* Add flag `use-entities` to prevent general entity interactions
* Add flag `use-items` to prevent general item usage
* Add flag `use-blocks` to prevent general block usage/interaction.
This should, beside other things, prevent using modded containers in contradiction to the access-container flag,
which only covers containers implementing vanilla mechanics.
* Add some sanity checks when setting region priority, so prevent mistakes for overlapping regions and region hierarchy
## Changes
* Reworked header format (the lines with == ... ==) to be more consistent and add a self-link to each header for easier accessibility.
* Remove `use` flag.
## Fixes
* Fix priority not set properly for Local Regions
* Fix some I18n typos and missing translations
## Notes
* Currently child regions do not overwrite flags of their parents. This means for example when having a parent with the break-block flag, which denies breaking blocks, and a child which doesn't have this flag, the flag of the parent still covers the child region.

* Spherical Regions are for now disabled. They will come back later with other shapes.
