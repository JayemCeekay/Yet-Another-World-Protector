# 0.0.1.4-beta4 - CLI improvements & priority fixes
## Additions
* Add flag `use-entities` to prevent general entity interactions
* Add flag `use-items` to prevent general item usage
* Add flag `use-blocks` to prevent general block usage/interaction.
This should, beside other things, prevent using modded containers in contradiction to the access-container flag,
which only covers containers implementing vanilla mechanics.
* Add some sanity checks when setting region priority, so prevent mistakes for overlapping regions and region hierarchy
## Changes
TODO: * Reworked header format (the lines with == ... ==) to be more consistent and add a self-link to each header for easier accessibility.
* Remove `use` flag.
## Fixes
* Fix priority not set properly for Local Regions
TODO: * Fix some I18n typos and missing translations
## Notes
* Currently child regions do not overwrite flags of their parents. This means for example when having a parent with the break-block flag, which denies breaking blocks, and a child which doesn't have this flag, the flag of the parent still covers the child region.



# 0.0.1.3-beta4
## Fixes
* Fix mod commands being executable without permission when using new alternative base command yawp
# 0.0.1.2-beta4 - I18n and flag fixes
## Additions
* Add link to Local and Dimensional Region info header to copy region NBT data to clipboard for more easy troubleshooting
* Added several new lang keys to cover the whole interactive CLI
* Added russian translation
* Add `no-pvp` flag. Opposite to the `melee-players` flag, this flag should cover all pvp dmg
* Explosion related flags now work in Local Regions
## Changes
* updated english and german translations
* cleared `break_blocks` and `place_blocks` from the default flags list for new dimensional and new local regions
* `/wp marker give` only works for the executor of the command (if it is a player)
* Remove non-functional `w_command_alt` config. `/yawp` is not a default alternative for `/wp`
## Fixes
* Fix `invincible` flag not working properly
# 0.0.1.1-beta4
## Fixes
* Fix `spawning-villager` flag working for wandering traders
# 0.0.1.0-beta4 - Local Region overhaul
This update brings the first iteration of working Local Regions. Due to some drastic changes in saving and loading region data, older regions are not supported - sorry!
Rest assured, once the mod goes from beta to release, these kinds of changes regarding will be kept to a minimum to ensure backwards compatibility.
## Additions
* Local Region flags are now implemented! Please visit the wiki for a full list of flags and for more information about how the Region hierarchy works.
* Add RegionMarker stick. Use it to mark an area for a new region and then either use the CLI to create the region or rename the stick in an anvil.
* Add sub-command to give a player a RegionMarker: `/wp marker give [<player>]`.
* Add sub-command to reset the state of a RegionMarker the player is holding: `/wp marker reset`.
* Add flag for knock-back protection against players.
To learn more about the priorities for overlapping regions and region hierarchy please visit the wiki.
* Add flag `spawning-slime`, `spawning-villager`, `spawning-trader`, `drop-loot-player`. Visit the wiki for detailed information about the flags.
## Changes
* Spherical Regions are for now disabled. They will come back later with other shapes.
* When removing a child region from a Local Region, its new parent will be the Dimensional Region and the child will be disabled.
* The flag command `/wp flag ...` is disabled for now. It has currently no real functionality and will come back in the next update.
* Deleting regions no longer works for regions with children. There will be a config option in a future update to enable this, though.
* Rename `attack-*` flags to `melee-*`. They only protect against melee attacks, hence the change.
* Disable explosion related flags. They will come back in the next update.
## Fixes
* Various CLI interface fixes regarding visualization and usability
# 0.0.1.0-beta3 - Minor fixes

# 0.0.1.0-beta2 - Local region preview
## Additions
* Add first beta implementation of local regions.
They come with two different area types: Cuboid and Sphere. More types will come soon!
NOTE: The flag checks for local regions are still missing, but you are still able to set up your regions.
They will be valid and working as soon as the checks are implemented in the next version.
* Add CLI to manage local regions. You are able to manage all properties of local regions with commands and with the interactive CLI.
For a comprehensive command overview take a look at the wiki.
* Add new config `allow_info_cmds` to enable the usage of informative region commands for all players.
* Add new config `dim_default_flags`, replacing `default_flags` for default flags for new dimensional regions.
## Changes
* Command to de-/activate dimensional regions changed from `activate` to `enable`.
* Config option `default_flags` is now used to define default flags for local regions.
## Fixes
